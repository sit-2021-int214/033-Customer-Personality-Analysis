# Workshop 01 EDA: SAT Scores dataset

Dataset from [SAT_original.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/SAT_original.csv)

**Created by Name-Surname (ID: 63130500091)**

### My Step
1. Define a question
2. Loading Library and dataset
3. xxxxxxx

## Define a question

1. How many observation of this dataset (before cleaning) ?
2. Are there duplicate data sets ? (If have duplicate data, list the data that duplicate)
3. How many distinct school in this dataset ? (Know after drop duplicate data)
4. What is min, max, average, quartile of each part in SAT ?
5. What is min, max, average, quartile of total score in SAT ?
6. Which school is get highest SAT score ?

Can add more question ....

## Step 0: Loading library and dataset

``` ruby
# Library
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(readr)
library(assertive)

# Dataset
SAT <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/SAT_original.csv")
```

## Step 1: Observation of this dataset before cleaning.

//Explain here

``` ruby
glimpse(SAT)
```

Result:

``` ruby
Rows: 485
Columns: 5
$ DBN           <chr> "01M292", "01M448", "01M450", "01M458", "01M509", "01M515", "~
$ school_name   <chr> "HENRY STREET SCHOOL FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDIES", "UNIVERSITY ~
$ math_score    <chr> "404", "423", "402", "401", "433", "557", "574", "418", "604"~
$ reading_score <chr> "355", "383", "377", "414", "390", "332", "522", "417", "624"~
$ writing_score <chr> "363", "366", "370", "359", "384", "316", "525", "411", "628"~
```

//Explain
- มี 485 แถว
- มี 5 คอลัมน์ คือ DBN, school_name, math_score, reading_score, writting_score
